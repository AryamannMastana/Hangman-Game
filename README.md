# Hangman-Game
Created a fun program as part of a personal, learning project which allows you to play Hangman with your computer!
Uses an imported list of words from the internet.
You need to guess letters correctly in order to win the game.
The Player is given 6 lives in the beginning and loses one for each wrong guess!
